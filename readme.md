# **Repro-API (alpha)**

The API helps with reproductions that require an API to be integrated, very useful in B2C / CIAM scenario, to test API connectors.
Note: *Currently the API returns an hardcoded JSON reponse.*


## **Roadmap**
- [x] Returns hardcoded JSON
- [ ] Returns customizable JSON
- [ ] Protect API (possibility to require Bearer token in Authorization header)
- [ ] Implement Workspaces (an Engineer might configure multiple instances per Entra ID / B2C / CIAM tenant)
